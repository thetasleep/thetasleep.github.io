      <h3>Processors</h3>

      <p>
        We use a number of secure processors for hosting and processing your
        data to provide our clinical service. All processors are subject to
        GDPR-compliant data processing agreements, ensuring the safety and
        security of your personal data. Services provided to us include document

        databases for our apps.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use your personal data</h2>

      <h3>Legal basis</h3>

      <p>
        The law requires us to have a legal basis for collecting and using your
        personal data in accordance with the UK General Data Protection (UK
        GDPR) and Data Protection Act (2018). We rely on one or more of the
        following legal bases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>For the provision of NHS care:</b> Where we are providing care for
          NHS patients, we are either directly responsible for your data (we are
          the data controller) or are jointly responsible for your data with
          another healthcare provider (we are a joint controller). In both
          cases, data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >For the provision of self-pay and private medical insurance
            patients:</b
          >
          In this instance, we have to use your personal data to deliver
          contractual services agreed with you or your insurer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >For data concerning health and other ‘special categories’ of
            data:</b
          >
          In accordance with the law, we process your health data for health and
          social care purposes. This includes preventative or occupational
          medicine, medical diagnosis, provision of health care or treatment, or
          the management of our health care system.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also use your personal information in the following limited
          circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Legal obligation:</b> We may use your personal data where it is
              necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are
              subject to. We will identify the relevant legal obligation when we
              rely on this legal basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Vital interests:</b> In rare cases we may use your personal
              data to protect your vital interests for example during a medical
              emergency
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Legitimate interests:</b> We may use your personal data (but
              not your health data) where it is necessary to conduct our
              business and pursue our legitimate interests. We make sure we
              consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights
              (both positive and negative) before we process your personal data
              for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for
              activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you
              (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or
              permitted to by law).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Consent:</b> We rely on consent only in cases where we have
              obtained your active agreement to use your personal data for a
              specified purpose, for example in the sharing of your sleep
              medicine story. Consent under data protection legislation will not
              be the basis for providing you with healthcare services. Your
              consent can be withdrawn at any time by contacting us at
              privacy@thetasleep.com
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the above grounds will overlap and there may be multiple
          justifications for the use of personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h3>
      <p>
        We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways
        we plan to use the various categories of your personal data, and which
        of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our
        legitimate interests are where appropriate. Your sleep and health data
        is classified as ‘special category’ personal data. Therefore, we need to
        have a specific reason to process this data. We only process this
        ‘special category’ data for the purpose of health and social care (as
        above).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the cases where we are the data controller, we use your data in the
        following ways:

      <h2>Disclosures of your personal data</h2>

      <p>
        We may share your personal data where necessary with the parties set out
        below for the purposes outlined in the table above.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Direct care services: who we may receive your information from and share
        your information with and why
      </h3>

      <p>
        Safe and effective care for patients relies on the exchange of relevant
        information among those directly involved in their ongoing treatment.
        Under section 251B of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, all health
        and adult social care providers are legally required to share patient
        information for the purpose of direct care. This obligation must be
        carried out in accordance with the Common Law Duty of Confidentiality,
        the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), and the Data
        Protection Act (DPA) 2018. Any personal data shared will be in line with
        your rights as outlined by these laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have the right to object to the sharing of your health information
        with other healthcare providers involved in your care. However, please
        be aware that exercising this right may impact the timeliness or quality
        of care you receive. If you choose to raise an objection, it is
        essential to discuss it with your primary healthcare provider to
        understand the potential consequences of your decision. It's important
        to note that this right is not absolute, and healthcare professionals
        may, in certain situations, override your objection due to legal
        obligations or professional duties.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may share your information with organisations and individuals
        directly involved in your care to facilitate effective provision of your
        healthcare needs. The types of individuals and organisations we may
        share your information with includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>

      <ol type="a">

          health professionals, and other members of the direct care support
          team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Diagnostic and medical device suppliers.</b> Diagnostic testing
          organisations are provided with relevant information to provide tests
          and/or book a test. Medical device suppliers are provided with your
          contact information and necessary health data to provide you with the
          diagnostic and treatment equipment you may require. We undertake
          strict due diligence procedures with respect to all third party
          suppliers.
        </li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Non-direct care where your information may be used and shared</h3>

      <p>
        When you use a health or care service, such as hospital or GP
        appointments, Accident & Emergency, or community care, important
        information about you is collected to ensure you receive the best care.
        This information may also be used by us and other approved organisations
        for lawful purposes, such as service planning, improving care, research,
        and illness prevention. Anonymised data will be used whenever possible
        for these purposes. Confidential health information is only shared in
        line with legal frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are legally required to share information in certain circumstances,
        such as to comply with legal obligations, court orders, or requests from
        regulatory bodies investigating complaints or incidents.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will always ensure there is a lawful basis for sharing your
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to direct care, your information may be used for non-care
        purposes, where lawful, and in compliance with data protection laws.
        Whenever possible, data will be anonymised or pseudonymised. These uses
        may include:

      <p>
        We may share your information with other organisations when there is a
        legal and legitimate reason to do so:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <b>Professional Regulatory Body Investigations</b>: These bodies have
          legal authority to request information for investigations related to

          relevant information is shared, and we will notify you and anonymise
          the data where possible.

        <li>
          <b>Care Quality Commission (CQC)</b>: Under the Health and Social Care

        <li>
          <b>Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</b>: The
          MHRA can only share information where justified, ensuring that any

            >NHS Digital, NHS England, Public Health England, and the Department
            of Health and Social Care</b

          <b>National and Other Professional Research/Audit Programmes</b>:

          <b>Third-Party Service Providers</b>: Organisations that support us
          with planning, managing, auditing, and defending legal claims may

        <li>
          <b>Other Third-Party Organisations with Your Consent</b>: If you give

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In any data sharing scenario, we will have a lawful basis on which to
        share the information.

      <h3>Business Transactions</h3>

      <p>
        If the company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your
        personal data may be transferred. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire
        other businesses or merge with them. The transfer of data will be
        managed in a secure manner in accordance with appropriate technical and
        organisational measures. We will provide notice before your personal
        data is transferred and becomes subject to different privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h3>Law enforcement</h3>

      <p>
        Under certain circumstances, the company may be required to disclose
        your personal data if required to do so by law or in response to valid
        requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
      </p>

      <h3>Other legal requirements</h3>

      <p>
        The company may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief
        that such action is necessary to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
        <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the company</li>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>

      <p>
        If we ever need to transfer your personal data outside of the UK, we
        will take steps to protect your privacy in line with data protection
        laws. Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure that the
        level of data protection remains equivalent to that within the UK and
        European Economic Area (EEA) as per UK adequacy regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Data security</h2>

      <p>
        We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
        personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
        unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
        your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
        third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
        your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
        confidentiality.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>

      <p>
        Your information is securely stored, and Theta Sleep will retain your
        personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
        in this Privacy Notice. Our records are generally kept for 20 years
        after our last interaction with patients, in line with NHS policies. We
        will keep and use your personal data to comply with legal obligations
        (such as when required by law), resolve disputes, and enforce our
        agreements and policies. The company will also retain usage data for
        internal analysis. This data is usually kept for a shorter period,
        unless it's needed to enhance security, improve service functionality,
        or required to be stored longer due to legal obligations.
      </p>

      <p>
        When determining how long to retain personal data, we consider factors
        like the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential
        risks from unauthorized access or disclosure, the purposes for
        processing, whether those purposes can be achieved in other ways, and
        any relevant legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some cases, we may anonymise your data (removing any link to you) for
        research or statistical purposes. In such cases, we may use this
        information indefinitely as this is no longer personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Protecting your sensitive data</h2>

      <p>Theta Sleep follows the information security values of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Confidentiality</b>: making sure your information is kept secret
          and private;

          cloud. We undertake annual third-party security audits and penetration
          tests with certified auditors as part of the NHS Data Security and
          Protection Toolkit requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Technology</b>: We adopt Secure by Design principles. REST APIs

      <h2>Your legal rights</h2>

      <p>
        You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to
        your personal data. Some of these rights are not absolute and will
        depend on the lawful basis we rely on for the processing of that data.
        We will comply with your request where law allows. Where we are unable
        to comply with your request we will inform you of this.
      </p>

      <b>You have the right to:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Request <b>access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a
          "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the
          personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
          processing it.
        </li>

        <li>
          Request <b>correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you.
          This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
          about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the
          new data you provide to us. However, we are not aware of any
          circumstances in which you will have the right to correct or delete
          health-related information from your records that is deemed accurate.
          Please contact us if you hold a different view.
        </li>

        <li>
          Request <b>erasure</b> of your personal data in certain circumstances.
          This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
          there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
          the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you
          have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
          below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or
          where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local
          law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
          request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified
          to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This right does not apply if the processing is necessary for
              health-related purposes, such as maintaining high standards of
              care, providing medical diagnosis, delivering health or social
              care services, or managing health and social care systems. If you
              believe the right to erasure applies to any specific processing
              activity involving your information, please contact us to review
              your request.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying
          on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) as the legal
          basis for that particular use of your data. In some cases, we may
          demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
          information which override your right to object.
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have the absolute right to object any time to the processing
              of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Request the <b>transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third
          party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
          personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
          Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
          initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
          information to perform a contract with you.

        <li>
          <b>Withdraw consent</b> at any time where we are relying on consent to
          process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
          lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
          consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
          case at the time you withdraw your consent.

        <li>
          <b>Request information</b> on automated decision making and profiling
          and right to object to decisions being made on the basis of automated
          profiling. We do not utilise any automated decision making or
          profiling of this nature.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Request restriction</b> of processing of your personal data. This
          enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data
          in one of the following scenarios:
          <ul>
            <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
            <li>
              Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to
              erase it;
            </li>
            <li>
              Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it
              as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
            </li>
            <li>
              You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
              whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
              contact us privacy@thetasleep.com
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        More information on all of these rights can be found on the Information
        Commissioner’s Office website.
      </p>

      <h3>No fee usually required</h3>

      <p>
        You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or
        to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
        reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
        excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in
        these circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3>What we may need from you</h3>

      <p>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
        your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
        exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
        that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
        receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
        in relation to your request to speed up our response.
      </p>

      <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>

      <p>
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
        Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
        particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
        case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
      </p>

      <h2>Complaints</h2>

      <p>
        You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information
        Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection
        issues. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your

        instance.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Changes to the Privacy Notice and your duty to inform us of changes
      </h2>

      <p>
        We keep our Privacy Notice under regular review. This version was last
        updated in March 2025. It is important that the personal data we hold
        about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your
        personal data changes during your relationship with us, for example a
        new address or email address.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party links</h2>

      <p>
        This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and
        applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may
        allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not
        control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their
        privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read
        the Privacy Notice of the websites you visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
        data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
        third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
        purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for
        specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
      </p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>

      <p>
        We may provide paid products and/or services within our service. In that
        case, we may use third-party services for payment processing (e.g.
        payment processors). We will not store or collect your payment card
        details. That information is provided directly to our third-party
        payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by
        their Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <h2>National Data Opt-Out (UK)</h2>

      <p>
        At this time, we do not share any personal data for planning or research
        purposes for which the national data opt-out would apply. We review all
        of the confidential patient information we process on an annual basis to
        see if this is used for research and planning purposes. If it is, then
        individuals can decide to stop their information being shared for this
        purpose. You can find out more information on the NHS website.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        Our Service does not knowingly address anyone under the age of 18. We do
        not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
        under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware
        that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.
        If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone
        under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we will
        take steps to remove that information from our servers.
