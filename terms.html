      <h2>12. Severance</h2>

      <p>12.1 If any provision or part of this agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it will be treated as removed, but this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the agreement.</p>

      <p>12.2 If any provision or part of a provision is removed under Clause 12.2, a replacement provision will be agreed that,  as much as possible, reflects the intended outcome of the original provision.</p>

      <p>13.1 These terms, and the relationship between you and Theta Sleep, will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, regardless of any conflict of law principles in other jurisdictions. Both you and Theta Sleep agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, except that Theta Sleep may seek injunctive relief in any jurisdiction to protect its rights under these terms.</p>

      <p>13.3 Any failure or delay by Theta Sleep in exercising or enforcing any right or provision of these terms will not be considered a waiver of that right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties agree that the court should, to the extent possible, give effect to the parties' original intentions as reflected in that provision. The remaining provisions of these terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>

      <p>13.4 You agree that these terms constitute the complete understanding between you and Theta Sleep regarding your relationship with Theta Sleep. These terms replace any prior agreements between you and Theta Sleep, including any previous versions of these terms.</p>

      <p>13.5 If you have a concern, we aim to address it without resorting to a formal legal case. Before pursuing a claim against us, you agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting hello@thetasleep.com. We will make an effort to resolve the issue informally. If the dispute remains unresolved within 15 days of submission, either you or we may initiate formal proceedings.</p>

      <p>13.7 Theta may utilise a subcontractor or other third party to perform its duties under this Agreement so long as Theta remains responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
